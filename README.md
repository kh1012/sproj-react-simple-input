# :zap: Getting Stated With React Simple Input

This repository offers M-API experiences using the "GET NODE" function.\
Instead of using HTML, you can create a readable web page with [React Library](https://ko.reactjs.org/).\
The overall structure is similar to the HTML, vitalize fixed `index.html` using `index.js`!
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

### Install the package for using
<br />

- In the cases of `react`, when executing `index.html` right after downloading, there's nothing on the web page generally.\
  During loading the web page, HTML becomes dynamic behavior through javascript.\
  (For the specifications, please refer here [react-Rendering Elements](https://ko.reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).)\
  For several reasons, the user needs to install the required package for execution.\
  <br />
- The 'Node package manager (npm)' was installed together when you installed 'NodeJS.'\
  npm is a package to install and handles various libraries easily that uses in NodeJS.\
  Also, npm can be written as `npm commands`in the VSCode terminal.\
  Please check the variety of information here: [npm-docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/).\
  <br />
- Run the `VSCode`.\
  Open the unzip downloaded folder `File - Open Folder...` or `Ctrl + K, O`\
  <br />

  <br />
  ![img](./img/terminalvscode.png)\
  <br />
  Input `npm i` or `npm install`in the activated terminal and run.\
  (If you installed `NodeJS` in the past, you could execute npm(node package manager).)\
  The package is installed automatically and pops up "finish".\

  <br />
  The complete message pops up if completed successfully, and the cursor status flicks as above.
<br /><br />

### Run Build
<br />

- `npm run build`\
  Creating and uploading MIDAS API Plug-ins using react only needs well-made result files using react.\
  All the data can be extracted as optimized HTML and JavaSctipt format without upload used In the development environment.\
  These processes are called "Build."\
  Typing `npm run build` in the terminal.\
  <br />
